I. Header & Navigation Fixes
Fix Header Overlap (CSS/Layout Bug): Locate the header/navigation bar section. Identify and fix the CSS or layout issue that is causing the header elements (logo, navigation links, and call-to-action buttons) to overlap or be compressed on the live site (referencing the issue shown in Image 1). Ensure proper spacing, padding, and vertical alignment for a clean, professional look on all screen sizes.

Remove Secondary CTA (Image 2): Remove the redundant floating or secondary "Get In Touch" button that appears in the body of the page. The primary "Book a Free Call" button in the main navigation should remain the sole call-to-action for consultation booking.,  Content & Aesthetics Refinements
Improve Red/Green Text Aesthetics (Image 3): In sections that compare generic coaching/tools with "Our Solution" (currently using red for challenges and green for solutions):

Goal: Change the colors to a palette that complements the website's professional blue/cream scheme.

Action: Replace the harsh red/green colors. Use a muted, harmonious color (e.g., dark gray or a soft warning color like muted orange) for negative/challenge dot points and a strong, professional blue or teal (matching the site's primary color) for the "Our Solution" checkmark/text. Update the checkmark and 'x' icons' styling to match these new colors.

Delete Package Reference (Image 5): Locate the pricing or FAQ section text and completely remove any reference to the old "₹550 for discovery calls" package.Form & Package Logic Updates
Update Corporate Form Logic (Image 4): In the lead/booking form for consultations, the "Current Background" field must be updated for a corporate audience.

Action: Replace the student-focused options (Class 8-9, Class 10-12, College Graduate, etc.) with professional-focused dropdown fields or input fields:

Designation

Company

Industry

This ensures the form captures relevant data for corporate/professional consultation requests.

Package Title: Executive Coaching / Health and Wellness Coaching
