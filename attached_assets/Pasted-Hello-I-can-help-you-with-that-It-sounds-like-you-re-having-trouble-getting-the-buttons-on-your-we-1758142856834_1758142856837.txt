Hello! I can help you with that. It sounds like you're having trouble getting the buttons on your website to do something when clicked, not just change when you hover over them. The key is to make sure your code includes **JavaScript** to handle the "click" event.

Here's a working prompt for Replit that's designed to make your buttons functional.

## **Replit Prompt: Make My Buttons Work**

### **Project Goal:**
Create a simple website with three distinct buttons that perform a specific action when clicked. The buttons should be more than just visual elements; they must have working functionality.

---

### **Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Button 1: The "Change Color" Button**
    * **Action:** When a user clicks this button, a specific `<div>` or a section of text on the page should change to a different, random color.
    * **Hint:** You'll need to use JavaScript to select the element and then manipulate its `style.backgroundColor` property.

2.  **Button 2: The "Toggle Text" Button**
    * **Action:** When a user clicks this button, a hidden message or paragraph should become visible. If it's already visible, clicking the button again should hide it.
    * **Hint:** This can be done by adding or removing a CSS class (e.g., `.hidden`) from the element using JavaScript.

3.  **Button 3: The "Count Clicks" Button**
    * **Action:** When a user clicks this button, a counter on the screen should increase by one. The current count should be displayed on the page.
    * **Hint:** You'll need a variable in your JavaScript to store the count and a way to update the text content of an HTML element with the new value.

### **Deliverables:**

* A complete, runnable Replit project containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
* The `index.html` file should contain all the necessary buttons and elements for the functionality.
* The `style.css` file should include any necessary styling (e.g., for the hidden message).
* The `script.js` file must contain the JavaScript code that makes the buttons work as described above.

This prompt is specific and actionable. It asks Replit not just to create a website, but to write the **JavaScript** code that is essential for making the buttons function. The examples are simple enough to be executed in a straightforward way, but they clearly demonstrate how to handle different types of user interaction.
