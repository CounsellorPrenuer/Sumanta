I. Header & Navigation Fixes
Fix Header Overlap (Image 3): Resolve the CSS/layout bug immediately. Ensure the header/navigation is fixed in position or has adequate margin/padding so that it does not overlap with the main page content below it. The navigation structure (logo, links, CTA) must be horizontally aligned and clearly spaced.

Remove Secondary CTA (Image 1): Remove the redundant "Get In Touch" button (which is often styled as a light orange callout) from the page body. Keep "Book a Free Call" in the navigation as the primary CTA.

II. Content & Aesthetics Refinements
Improve Red/Green Text Aesthetics (Image 3 - Previous Request): In sections that compare generic coaching/tools with "Our Solution" (currently using red for challenges and green for solutions):

Action: Change the color scheme for these sections. Use a dark neutral color (e.g., #333333 or text-gray-800) for the negative points (challenges/limitations). Use the site's primary blue/teal color for the solution checkmarks and text to maintain brand consistency and professionalism.

Delete Package Reference (Image 5 - Previous Request): Locate the pricing or FAQ section text and completely remove any reference to the old "₹550 for discovery calls" package.

III. Form & Package Logic Updates
Update Corporate Form Logic (Image 4 - Previous Request): In the lead/booking form for consultations, the "Current Background" field must be updated for a corporate audience.

Action: Replace the student-focused options (Class 8-9, Class 10-12, College Graduate, etc.) with professional-focused dropdown fields or input fields:

Designation

Company

Industry

This ensures the form captures relevant data for corporate/professional consultation requests.

Add New Coaching Package (Image 2): Add a new pricing/service card to the packages section, positioned alongside the "Ascend Plus" package.

Package Title: Executive Coaching / Health and Wellness Coaching

Content:

Personalized 1:1 Coaching Sessions

Goal Clarity & Roadmap Creation

Work–Life Integration & Resilience Building

Progress Tracking & Accountability Support

Exclusive Resources & Continuous Support

Implement Pricing Disclaimer: For all service/package cards (Ascend, Ascend Plus, and the new Executive Coaching package):

Add an asterisk (*) next to the displayed Price and Duration fields (if duration is listed).

Include the following small disclaimer text clearly visible beneath the pricing section:

*Prices and Duration will be finalized and decided post the Initial Free Consultation.
